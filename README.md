# Contributing and branching strategy

The main branch is develop and it is where all features go first. We use master for releases.

Always work on new things in a separate, new, branches and when ready initiate a pull request against develop. Add @vvatkov and @agpetrov as reviewers.

When ready rebase you work from develop to master (git checkout master, git rebase develop) and follow the steps in HandlingUpdates, update package.json following the semver rules.
